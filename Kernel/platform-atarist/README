This is an initial 'gee it compiles' work in progress initial 68000 port

Don't expect it to do anything !


Notes:
	Memory below $0800 is supervisor only (traps)

Need to support 'resident' style binaries
Start of disk boot block info ?

Tidy up di/ei usage - we don't want to turn on hblank at random in our ei
stuff!!!

First boot sector loaded into buffer. must checksum to $1234
then executed. Must be PI

Eventually need multi-segment executables
